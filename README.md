# CS523-TopDownCausation
Project for CS523 for recreating the results of Evolutionary Transitions and Top-Down Causation. And explore the possibility of apply logistic map to real world COVID cases.

## For generating part 1:
Set the parameter in "ggg/src/init.json" and run the code in "ggg/src/docker-run.sh".

## For generating part 2:
Generate data over the file logistic_map.py. Execute the file MIcalc.m to generate mutual information. Execute the file TEcalc.m to generate transfer entropy.

## For generating part 3: 
The R file US-CA.

## For generating part 4:
The R files NM-AZ and VM-WY.
